# Preface

The purpose of this document is to condense the information for
people who like seeing things in writing or simply want a quick
reference guide that provides context.


# Introduction

People use Git for **version source control**--the ability
to store and track different versions of code.

Imagine you're assigned to a project and have to edit the
implementation of a feature. After completing your work,
the client is happy with the results. A few days later,
however, the client reaches back out with a changed
mind and asks to revert back to the old way
the feature worked. What do you do? How do you
rewrite your code to get it back to the way
it was before?

Git solves that problem by allowing you to go back to
any **commit**--which can be thought of as a checkpoint or
saving point--made to the project. Thanks to source control,
a potentially six hour task just turned into a sixty second task.

Among other things, Git allows you to more easily collaborate with others.
If there are two features being worked on, you and another person can
make **branches** of a **repository** and work on each feature independently
of one another, then **merge** the changes back into the main branch.
Git allows us to 'divide and conquer.'

**This guide assumes that you have access to Git from the
command line (you will likely get it through the Git for
Windows installation if using Windows) and a GitHub profile.
The information contained within this document applies to
hosting services other than GitHub (like GitLab or Azure
DevOps). GitHub is essentially a drop-in for an online
hosting service.**


# Setting Up Git

## About

Once you've gone through the installation process and set up an account
on GitHub, you are ready connect your account to your computer by
using the command line. **Git Bash** is the most popular command line
interface for Git on the Windows operating system.

If you are an R programmer like me, you will want to connect
your favorite command line program to Rstudio. To do this
go to **Tools\>Global Options\>Terminal** and set
'New terminals open with:' to your preferred command line.
I recommend using Git Bash if you're on Windows.
Everything done in the remainder of this document can be
done in the Rstudio terminal's Git Bash. Most IDEs have
some sort of integration with Git. I personally find
integrated terminals to be a bit slow and instead keep
a terminal open as a standalone process. But it's good
to keep all of your tools together in one place--especially
when you're learning.

## Commands

-   `git config --global user.name USER_NAME_HERE`:
    Set the user (your GitHub profile name).

-   `git config user.name`: See who the current user is.

-   `git config --global user.email USER_EMAIL@DOMAIN.com`:
    Set user email (an email connected to your GitHub profile).


# BASH Essentials

## About

This section covers the 'essentials' of navigating through your
file system, along with the creation and deletion of files.
These commands have nothing to do with Git proper but are vital
to getting anything done from a command line. The keyboard was
invented a long time before the mouse!

NOTE: A **directory** is what Apple and Microsoft have taught you
to call a 'folder'--the two are synonymous, but directory is
the more official term. When you see, for example, the
**mkdir** command, know that it creates what you might be used
to calling a folder.

NOTE: If a file or folder name contains a space,
surround the path in quotes.

## Commands

-   `cd FILE_PATH`: Changes the CURRENT DIRECTORY to the file path.

-   `cd FOLDER_IN_DIRECTORY`: Moves the current directory 'down' into
    the specified directory found in the current working directory.

-   `cd ..`: Moves to the current directory to the parent directory
    (move 'up' one folder).

-   `mkdir FOLDER_NAME`: Creates a new directory in current working directory.

-   `touch FILE_NAME.EXTENSION`: Creates a file in the current directory
    (Ex. **touch words.txt** would create an empty text file called
    **words** in the current working directory).

-   `rm FILE_NAME.EXTENSION`: Deletes/removes the specified file
    in the current directory.

-   `ls`: lists all files and folders in the current working directory.


# Repository Setup and Status

## About

The whole point of Git and GitHub is to have a location where code and its history
is kept, tracked, and maintained. We want to create a **repository**, which
you can think of as a folder where Git tracks files and the changes made to those files.

Any folder on your computer containing a **.git** folder is a Git repository.
This directory is the repository's **root directory**, and any files in
the root directory or any subfolder of the root directory will be tracked
by Git.

Now, there are a few things we need to get started with a repository.
Some things we should to do are:

1.  Create a repository.

2.  Check the status of the files in the repository.

3.  Add files and folders to the **staging area** (tracked files) of the repository.

4.  Remove files and folders from the staging area of the repository before a commit.

5.  Make commits.

6.  See commit history.

## Commands

-   `git init`: Creates a Git repository in the current working directory.
    I recommend that you instead create your repository on a hosting service
    (like GitHub) if you plan to use a hosting service (sometimes you'll only
    want to track your changes locally).

-   `git status`: Identifies changes made to the repository since your last commit.

-   `git add path_to_file_or_dir`: Adds a file, or all untracked files in a
    directory, to the staging area of the repository.

-   `git add .`: Adds all files not in the gitignore to the staging area
    (everything you would see as 'untracked' in a git status).

-   `git rm --cached .`: Removes all files and folders from the staging area of the repository.

-   `git commit -m "COMMIT MESSAGE HERE"`: Makes a 'save point' in your repository
    with the (required) commit message. Make sure commit messages are logical and
    succinctly detail changes made since the last commit.

-   `git log`: Shows commit history, along with the commit ID.

The basic workflow is `git status; git add file_name; git commit -m "short description of changes";`


# Undoing Things

## About

If you simply want to bring a file (whose changes have not been committed)
back to the state at the head of the current branch (you know, the way the
file looked *before* you made any changes), you'll want to use the
**restore** command. I also suggest you look into the **rebase** command
if you want to remove, edit, or combine commits.

If, however, you need to go back to a previous 'save point' in your
project's history, we are going to do so using one of three types of
commits that 'undo' previous changes. These commits are the following:

1.  Checkout commit (a 'read only' commit)

2.  Revert commit (undo a particular commit)

3.  Reset commit (permanently takes you back in time to a particular commit)

NOTE: Use **git log** to determine which commit you want to 'go back' to.


## Commands

-   `git restore PATH_AND_FILENAME`: Reloads the version of the file found at
    the most recent commit.

-   `git rebase HEAD~number_of_commits_that_you_want_to_change -i`: Allows you to
    rework commits in the history. You can reword commit messages, combine commits
    together, or remove commits outright, among other things.

-   `git checkout COMMIT_ID`: Shows the code as it was at the specified commit.
    This is a 'read-only' copy in that none of the changes made to the
    repository after running the command will be permanent.

-   `git revert COMMIT_ID`: Undoes a particular commit in the commit log.
    If some strange text program pops up, you are in a program called Vim.
    Vim is a wonderful text editor and I suggest you learn it, but for now
    know that you can exit out of Vim by typing `:wq` then ENTER.
    Once complete, you have created a new commit that undoes
    the specified commit you wanted removed.

-   `git reset COMMIT_THAT_YOU_WANT_TO_RESET_TO_ID`: Reverts the repository back to
    the commit that you had at the supplied commit ID. Locally, the files will
    not change (in case you want to keep specific files, you made a mistake,
    etc.), but they will be gone from your commit history. BE CAREFUL.

-   `git reset COMMIT_THAT_YOU_WANT_TO_RESET_TO_ID --hard`: Reverts the repository
    back to the state it was in the specified commit. None of the changes made after
    the specified commit will be retained. A hard reset. WARNING: THERE IS NO WAY TO
    GET BACK TO THOSE PREVIOUS COMMITS--UNLIKE THE REVERT COMMIT, ANYTHING UNDONE IN
    A RESET COMMIT IS DELETED FROM THE COMMIT HISTORY.


# Branches

## About

The main branch is typically the stable release of your code,
the one you publish. For that reason, you should not perform
active development on it. We do not want to find ourselves
in a circumstance where we mess up our code with new features
when others will be using said code.

The idea behind a branch is to try out new ideas in an isolated
environment and, if it meets all requirements, merge it back
into the main branch.

Instead of writing commits directly to the main,
make a new branch. Add commits to this new branch and
combine the two with a merge commit or a pull request.

Git Bash will tell you which branch you are working in--it is in
parentheses on the line above your cursor.

NOTE: Any branch you create will be 'a copy' of the branch you
are currently using.

## Commands

-   `git branch -a`: Shows all branches in the repository. The branch
    with an asterisk next to it denotes which branch you are using.

-   `git branch NEW_BRANCH_NAME`: Creates a new branch of the specified branch name.

-   `git switch BRANCH_NAME`: Switches to the specified branch name.

-   `git branch -d BRANCH_NAME`: Deletes the specified branch if the branch
    is merged (the '-d' means 'delete'). NOTE: switch to the main branch
    before deleting the branch by running `git checkout main`.

-   `git branch -D BRANCH_NAME`: Deletes the specified branch regardless of
    merge status (the '-D' means 'delete'). NOTE: switch to the main branch
    before deleting the branch by running `git checkout main`.

-   `git switch -c BRANCH_NAME`: Creates the branch and moves to it in one motion.


# Branch Merging and Conflicts

## About

After preparing code for production in different branches, we
need a way to combine all of the changes made across them back together.
That's where the merge command comes into play.

## Commands

-   `git merge BRANCH_NAME`: Merges the specified branch
    *into the branch you are currently using*. Sometimes,
    you will come across conflicts; if you have a conflict,
    make the necessary changes to the file (that usually means delete a bunch of stuff
    [\<\<\<\<\<\<\<\<\<\< HEAD, ========, \>\>\>\>\>\>\>\>\> BRANCH_NAME, lines of code, etc.]
    and keep only what you need--talk to the person who made the conflicting changes to see what
    they want if you are unsure of what should stay and what shouldn't. Also know that
    you should not commit anything to the main branch directly.), add the file back
    to the branch, do a git commit *without the '-m' or a commit message*.
    If Vim opens, type `:wq` and hit ENTER.

NOTE: Pull requests are conceptually the UI equivalent of merge commits. Depending on the
branch security, a merge commit may fail not be allowed and a pull request will be
necessary to integrate your changes back into the project. Pull requests are generally
easier to do than merge commits, but merging is important for resolving conflicts
between branches.


# Hosted Repos

## About

Most of the time, you will work on projects in local repositories and
then **push** them online to the central, hosted project repository on
GitHub.com, GitLab, Azure DevOps, etc.. When code gets pushed to the hosted
repository (the changes you've saved with a commit are uploaded to the internet),
someone can **pull** the code onto their local machine to
continue developing off of the changes that someone else made. This is
what makes collaboration possible between developers.

### Creating a Repository on GitHub

There are two types of repositories, **public** and **private**.
If you create a public repository, be careful about what you upload
because anyone on the internet can see what you put on there. Always
add a **README**, **gitignore** (it allows you to add folders and files
that your repository will ignore in the tracking process), and **license**.
I'm no legal expert, but a license sounds like it might be useful
dealing with plagiarism.

### Pull Requests

Once your code is ready to merge back into the main branch,
create a pull request on the repository's hosting service.
If approved (maybe you are the one doing the approval!),
it can be merged.

## Commands

-   `git clone REPO_URL`: Makes a local version of the specified GitHub repository
    in the current working directory.

-   `git push REPO_URL BRANCH_NAME`: Moves the code written on your local version
    to the hosted (online) version. The repository URL is often stored as an alias
    called *origin* (see next bullet). On GitHub.com, the repository url can be found
    by clicking the green 'Code' button in your repository and clicking on the
    clipboard next to the url.

-   `git add remote REPO_ALIAS_NAME REPO_URL`: Allows you to use an alias for the
    repository's url instead of having to write the URL in the REPO_URL field of
    all future commands (in a git push, for example). 'origin' is a very popular
    alias to use. Aliases must be created for each repository, *but only once*--you
    should not have to do it when cloning a repository that already has aliases.

-   `git remote -v`: Shows all of a repository's aliases.

-   `git pull REPO_URL BRANCH_NAME`: Fetches all of the code from the hosted repository
    and merges it into your your local version of the branch, updating all of your local
    files. *Use this to get the most up-to-date code on a branch.*


# Forking and Contributing

## About

Forks are often used to contribute to an open source project. If you come across someone
else's code on GitHub, you won't be able to contribute directly to that person's
branches. What you have to do instead is **fork** that repository, which is a copy
of the repository from the project creator's account to your own account. Doing so
creates that repository on your own account and you can begin working on it as if
it were your own.

To contribute the changes you've made to the original repository, create a
'New pull request' on GitHub. Create the pull request and then wait for the
repository admins to review and merge the contribution (or reject it!).

If someone contributes to your own repository, click on the 'Pull requests'
tab of your repository, review the changes, make comments, and ultimately decide
whether to accept or reject the contribution by clicking the green 'Merge pull request'
button.

Every project has different guidelines to contributing. Check the files in the
repository for these kinds of contribution rules.
